## Built with

  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Flexbox

### What I learned

* To change color only for a few words in a sentence -> <span>.
* To change image from desktop to mobile use <picture>.
* Image in html vs css as background. See first useful link.
* To fit an image inside container -> width: 100%.
* Background coming through image -> 'opacity' for the image (not background).
* Border-radius with images use overflow: hidden.
* Place image in the middle -> flexbox with align-item: center.
* Use flex-direction: column-reverse.
* It was a thin line on top and under the image with background color. To fix it  ->   increase width of the card.
